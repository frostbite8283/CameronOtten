    <h1>Complier 2022</h1>
    This is an example of  the compiler I developed in 2022 as is from the state it was in when presented to clients.
    <br />
    <h2>Goal: compile SQL like statements into JSON for processing.</h2>
    <br /><br />

    <h2>Requirements:</h2>
    <br />
    - Allow the creation and use of custom metrics
    <br />
    - preform lexical, syntax and semantic analysis
    <br />
    - use python and ReGex
    <br />
    - give each a UUID and a readable name
    <br />
    - Ensure vairables don't overlap
    <br />
    - Compile to a JSON structure for further processing
    indicating operator and input
    <br /><br />

    <h2>My implementation:</h2>
    <br />
    - use a dictionary to allow additional metrics.
    <br />
    - append the strings to the TOKENS list to reserve the words
    <br />
    - Use ReGex to compress and evaluate statements.
    <br />
    - Generate a UUID using uuid library and place in the JSON structure
    <br />
    - Add a counter which adds on to the end of every created metric
    to ensure no overlap.
    <br />
    - During evaluation create a JSON struct
    <br /><br />

    <h2>Final Result:<br /></h2>
    A basic one line compiler with the following structure.
    <br />
    1. input: statement
    <br />
    2. input: name
    <br />
    4. output: list of metrics
    <br />
    3. output: errors, or the metric and its JSON structure.
    <br />
    4. Debug output: the full JSON structure created and stored.
