<h1 id="project-description">Project Description</h1>
<p>Project mercury is a fast paced first person shooter focused on advanced movement
that aims to make the player feel like an experienced agent. Project mercury is set in the year of 2093 and the player is tasked with retrieving valuable data from Detroit which is now inhabited by only robots.</p>
<h1 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h1>
<p>The goal of this project was to show of the skills of the 14 people on the team and display the quality we could achieve in 5 months. Personally, I worked on the developing the enemy AI. With this being my first time working in Unreal Engine I had three goals in mind. First, learn to use Unreal Engine and apply my previous experience. Second, to grow my knowledge by developing AI for a new style of game.  Third, and finally, to show off my skills as an AI developer.</p>
<h1 id="my-contributions">My Contributions</h1>
<!-- I created two types of enemies. This first type is a simple enemy named Boom. This enemy waits around until it detects the player. Once it does it charges them and detonates its deadly surprise. This enemy's behaviour was simple and making it was my introduction to working in Unreal.   -->

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<!-- This next enemy type comes in three variants. This enemy type called the Patrol Agent. These enemies  are a classic guy with a gun style. Except in this case they're robots. Each variant patrols a set route until it detects the player then fires upon them with their weapon of choice. A classic assault rifle, a brutal shotgun, or a deadly sniper. Each makes decisions befitting their weapon, but all run off the same structure.  -->

</tr>
</tbody>

<h1 id="early-designing">Early Designing</h1>
<p>The first step for making any enemy is figuring out what enemy you want to make. What this means for me is talking with designers and those within the enemy pod of our team. With design being an iterative process we started with verbal communication and simple behaviours. This included things such as the early behaviours of the patrol agent. It had simple enough behaviour. Patrol a set of points, investigate sound, and shoot the player if it sees them. For me this was also a chance to see how my past experience with AI and enemy development translated into Unreal Engine.</p>
<h1 id="first-implementation">First Implementation</h1>
<!-- 
I prefer a behaviour first approach building out the structure before implementing the functionality. So I started with a BTree its blackboard. While every agent's Btree has its own needs, the patrol variant follows the same structure. -->

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
 <!-- The BTree and blackboard were of course followed by an AI Controller. This was followed by testing to ensure everything got called when expected. Testing here is especially important to catch bugs early before reusing the structure for other patrol agents. -->

</tbody>

<!-- Finally, after testing is succesful, its time to implement the task functionality. This included working with our weapons programmer who provided me enemy versions of the guns which would be used by the patrol agents. Finished off with some more testing to make sure there were no immediate bugs. -->

<h1 id="challenges">Challenges</h1>
<p>Due to their simplicity the enemies were naturally less interesting to fight. They moved and preformed as intended, but they left something to be desired. Nobody in a gun fight wants to stand in the open! So now the question becomes, how do I get an enemy to find cover?</p>
<p>Later as more of the players actions made produced sound for the enemies they became overwhelmed and sometimes went towards the sound stimuli instead of attacking the player.</p>
<h1 id="final-designs">Final Designs</h1>
<!-- For the final design the enemy pod once again met this time creating flow charts for each enemy. With the new enemy behaviours created it was now time to address the challenges. -->

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h1 id="final-implementation">Final Implementation</h1>
<!-- For the final implementation I began by making a BTree based off the designed behaviour flow chart. While behaviour flow charts are nice, they are not a one to one translation to implementation. I created appropriate states to accomodate the behaviour. I followed by filling out each state with the appropriate tasks. I also made an accompanying blackboard. -->

<td><img src="BTreeV2.png" alt="new BTree and blackboard"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<!-- The new BTree also created a need to update the perception handling. Creating the new perception handling also provided the gate to stop the agent from acknowledging sound detection while already having sight of the player. This is once again followed by testing. -->

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<!-- With the new behaviour implemented it was time to provide the enemies the ability to find cover. For this I used Unreal Engine's Environment Query system. This allowed me to quickly find strategic postions for enemies use during combat. Once the Queries were ready and tested I finished off with implementing the tasks. -->

<h1 id="cut-content">Cut Content</h1>
<!-- At the beginning of the project we wanted to have a boss to finish off the level. With the boss being a big project both the other AI programmer and I worked on it. The boss was designed similarly to the rest. Starting off with a behaviour flow chart. -->

<!-- The flow chart was once again followed by a BTree and blackboard. We even began implementing tasks. However, as it came time to really polish the enemy we realized we certain aspects of the boss came to late. As such, we decided to cut our losses as we did not feel we had the time to bring it to the level of quality we wanted and decided against ending the level with something that did not match the quality of the rest of the game. -->

<h1 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h1>
<p>Throughout the project I learned Unreal Engine and worked with blueprint for the first time. During the early implementation our there were some troubles communicating with the enemy designer on the exact details. This was remedied by behaviour flow charts creating a middle ground between design and implementation.</p>
<p>I also learned that I need to fully explore any engine I'm working with as best I can before implementing code. Having a better understanding of Unreal Engine's AI systems, especially the Environmental Query System, would have helped immensely with the first implementation and saved time on the final implementation.</p>
