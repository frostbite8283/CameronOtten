<h1 id="project-description">Project Description</h1>
<p>Project mercury is a fast paced first person shooter focused on advanced movement
that aims to make the player feel like an experienced agent. Project mercury is set in the year of 2093 and the player is tasked with retrieving valuable data from Detroit which is now inhabited by only robots.</p>
<h1 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h1>
<p>The goal of this project was to show of the skills of the 14 people on the team and display the quality we could achieve in 5 months. Personally, I worked on the developing the enemy AI. With this being my first time working in Unreal Engine I had three goals in mind. First, learn to use Unreal Engine and apply my previous experience. Second, to grow my knowledge by developing AI for a new style of game.  Third, and finally, to show off my skills as an AI developer.</p>

<td>This next enemy type comes in three variants. This enemy type called the Patrol Agent. These enemies  are a classic guy with a gun style. Except in this case they're robots. Each variant patrols a set route until it detects the player then fires upon them with their weapon of choice. A classic assualt rifle, a brutal shotgun, or a deadly sniper. Each makes decisions befitting their weapon, but all run off the same structure.</td>

<h1 id="early-designing">Early Designing</h1>
<p>The first step for making any enemy is figuring out what enemy you want to make. What this means for me is talking with designers and those within the enemy pod of our team. With design being an iterative process we started with verbal communication and simple behaviours. This included things such as the early behaviours of the patrol agent. It had simple enough behaviour. Patrol a set of points, investigate sound, and shoot the player if it sees them. For me this was also a chance to see how my past experience with AI and enemy development translated into Unreal Engine.</p>

<h1 id="challenges">Challenges</h1>
<p>However, these enemies were naturally less interesting to fight. They moved and preformed as intended, but they left something to be desired. Nobody in a gun fight wants to stand in the open! So now the question came, how do I get an enemy to find cover?</p>
<p>Later as more of the players actions made produced sound for the enemies they became overwhelmed and sometimes went towards the sound stimuli instead of attacking the player.</p>

<td>For the final implementation I began by making a BTree based off the designed behaviour flow chart. While behaviour flow charts are nice, they are not a one to one translation to implementation.

Creating the new perception handling also provided the gate to stop the agent from acknowledging sound detection while already having sight of the player. This is once again followed by testing.|</p>
<p>| With the new behaviour implemented it was time to provide the enemies the ability to find cover. For this I used Unreal Engine's Environment Query system. This allowed me to quickly find strategic postions for enemies use during combat. Once the Queries were ready and tested I finished off with implementing the tasks. | <img src="file:///c:\Users\gamep\Documents\GitHub\Frostbite8283.github.io\BoomBTree.png" alt="EQS Debug">     |</p>

<h1 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h1>
<p>Throughout the project I learned Unreal Engine and worked with blueprint for the first time. During the early implementation our there were some troubles communicating with the enemy designer on the exact details. This was remedied by behaviour flow charts creating a middle ground between design and implementation.</p>
<p>I also learned that I need to fully explore any engine I'm working with as best I can before implementing code. Having a full Unreal Engine's AI systems, especially the Environmental Query System, would have helped immensely with the first implementation. With what I know now I'm excited to see just how much I can accomplish and learn on my next projects.</p>
